	<h2><br>Fashion in London</h2>
	<p id = "P9" style = "margin-top: 11px">During our London itinerary, we noticed that Londoners have a different style depending on their postcode. Chelsea residents are usually found<br>
																		dressed in colourful chinos and espadrilles or skinny jeans with riding boots<br><br>

																<br>The super wealthy locals of Notting Hill are a little more polished and have expensive tastes including designer handbags, blingy watches and<br>
																		diamond earrings. But, East London is without a doubt one of the trendiest areas of the city, with Hoxton hipsters donning bold, vintage pieces<br>
																		purchased from one of the many retro boutiques or charity stores on their doorstep.<br><br>

	<p id = "P10">									<br>London may be one of the fashion capitals of the world, but its style is defined by casual, dressed-down looks. And this is true of a night out.<br>
																		Going out straight from work is a common occurrence in London, so skinny jeans and trainers are a typical Friday night ensemble. And since<br>
																		Londoners get about by tube or on foot, practicality is key. The arrival of street food festivals, trendy eateries, secret cinemas, relaxed rooftop<br>
																		bars, and concerts has only added to the capital's casual style. If you're out all the time, it doesn't feel like an occasion to dress up for.<br><br>
