				<p id = "paragraph1" style = "margin-top: 14px">London, the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. The city stands on the River Thames in the south-east of England,<br>
													at the head of its	50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea. London has been a major settlement for two millennia, and was originally<br>
													called Londinium, which was founded by the Romans.</p>
				
				<h2><br>History of London</h2>
				<p id = "paragraph2">The city of London was founded by the Romans and their rule extended from 43 AD to the fifth century AD, when the Empire fell. During the<br>
													third century,Londinium, the name given to the town by the Romans, had a population of 50,000, mainly due to the influence of its major port.<br><br>
													
													As a consequence of repeated Anglo-Saxon invasions during the fifth century, Londinium declined and during the eighth century it became<br> 
													thecapital of the Kingdom of Essex. During the ninth century, the town suffered numerous Viking attacks. As a consequence, Danish settlers<br>
													established themselves in the area, encouraging trade and opening businesses in the town, transforming it into the first urban centre of England.<br>
													The town’s wealth and power attracted the Danish Great Heathen Army, which besieged the city until it was captured by King Alfred the<br>
													Great in 886.<br><br>
													
													In 1067, following the Norman invasion and conquering of England, the city's existing rights, laws and privileges were established by the newly<br>
													crowned King of England, William Duke of Normandy. The Tower of London was built during William's reign. In 1199, King John reinforced<br>
													the city's self-government, and	in 1215	the city could elect a different mayor every year.For many years, England had no capital city. However,<br>
													the institutions of central government were moved to	Westminster, close to London. This and the rise of trade in the area were two decisive<br>
													factors in London's emergence as the capital of England. <a href = "https://www.londoncitybreak.com/history" target = "_blank" style = "text-decoration: none; color: rgba(16,148,224);">more...</a> 
				
				<h2><br>Facts About London You Probably Didn’t Know</h2><br>
				<p id = "paragraph3"><b>#1</b> To become a black cab driver is not an easy task. Each potential driver must complete a rigorous test called The Knowledge,<br>
																		which involves memorizing every street or alley in London. Every-single-one! It takes years and a lot of walks for the future<br>
																		cab drivers to learn them all. No wonder they charge so much. Black Cabs are very famous and are part of the London culture<br>
																		, you can see them everywhere. But to become a Black Cab driver is not so easy. Typically, the training last for 2 to 4 years<br>
																		and candidates must memorize every single street in London.<br><br>

													<b>#2</b> Rainy London isn’t very rainy. The capital is known worldwide for being a rainy city. Except for the fact, that it’s not true at all.<br>
																		London actually sees less rain than Rome, Miami, and Sydney both in terms of volume and number of rainy days.<br><br>

													<b>#3</b> ‘Big Ben’ isn’t actually called Big Ben. Tourists from all over the world come to stand on Westminster Bridge and take a selfie<br>
																		next to Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Unfortunately, not one of them ever leaves with a picture of it. This world-famous<br>
																		landmark is actually named the Elizabeth Tower – Big Ben is the name of the bell that lives inside. So you won’t snap a photo of<br>
																		Big Ben but if you’re lucky you might get to hear it.<br><br>

													<b>#4</b> Raven Tower. I can’t have a fun-facts list and not include at least one animal fact, right? You probably don’t know, but for the<br>
																		last few hundred years, there have always been at least six ravens living in the Tower of London. The legend has it that if they<br>
																		leave, the White tower is doomed to fall, and a great disaster befalls the Kingdom.<br><br>
																		
																		There are seven currently, and their names are Jubilee, Harris, Gripp, Rocky, Erin, Poppy, and Merlina. They even have a<br>
																		Ravenmaster to tend to their needs!<br><br>
